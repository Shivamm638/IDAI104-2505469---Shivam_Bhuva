### Interplanetary Mission Intelligence & Rocket Simulation Platform  

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Cosmic Mission Control is an advanced aerospace analytics and rocket simulation web application developed using Python and Streamlit.

This project integrates:

- Mathematical modeling (Newton’s Laws of Motion)
- Statistical data analysis
- Interactive visualization
- Real-time physics simulation
- Web deployment using Streamlit Cloud

The objective is to simulate interplanetary rocket missions while analyzing mission data to derive meaningful insights regarding performance, budget efficiency, and mission success.

## 🎯 Problem Understanding & Research

Space missions are influenced by multiple physical and operational factors:

- Thrust produced by rocket engines  
- Gravitational force of destination planets  
- Payload weight  
- Fuel consumption  
- Budget constraints  
- Mission objectives  

The simulation is based on Newton’s Second Law:

Acceleration = (Thrust − Mass × Gravity) / Mass

Key considerations:

- As fuel burns, rocket mass decreases  
- Lower mass increases acceleration  
- Higher gravity increases mission difficulty  
- Budget does not always guarantee mission success  

This model reflects real aerospace engineering principles and real-world mission planning logic.

## 🚀 Rocket Simulation Model

The simulation calculates rocket motion over time using numerical integration.

### Mathematical Model

Acceleration:
a = (T − m × g) / m  

Velocity Update:
v = v + a × dt  

Altitude Update:
h = h + v × dt  

Where:

- T = Thrust  
- m = Mass  
- g = Planet Gravity  
- dt = Time step
